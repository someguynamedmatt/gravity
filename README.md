## Gravity
> simulation of point masses using Rust's `wasm-bindgen` library

To get this up and running on your machine:


- Clone the repo
- `cd` into the `gravity` directory
- `cargo install wasm-bindgen-cli`
- `./build.sh`
- The project will be running on `localhost:8080`


Work in Progress: while this compiles and runs it doesn't actually do anything yet. Nonetheless, you can use this as a template for your own `wasm-bindgen` project.
